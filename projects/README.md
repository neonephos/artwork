# Logos and Icons

Please upload logos and icons only in ```.svg``` format. The ```.png``` in this repository may not be kept.

We are following the naming convention of the [CNCF artwork repository](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/tree/main/projects).

> [!NOTE]  
> Please ensure that your artwork is appropriately cropped to reduce unnecessary whitespace.

## Horizontal

These are horizontal logos in a rectangular (but nonsquare) format. The vertical side length is smaller than the horizontal side length.

## Stacked

These are stacked logos like roundels or others in or near a 1:1 format. They typically contain the project name at the bottom and the icon at the top.

## Icon

These are icons for use in e.g. toolbars. Icons are often simplified versions of the stacked logos.
